# Contributing to NexusHub

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NexusHub! We welcome contributions from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct (to be established, but generally means be respectful and constructive).

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to NexusHub, from reporting bugs to writing code and improving documentation.

### Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please ensure it hasn't already been reported by searching the existing issues on our issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues for the project).
If it's a new bug, please open a new issue with:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the bug.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
- Screenshots or screen recordings if helpful.
- Information about your environment (e.g., browser version, operating system).

### Suggesting Enhancements or New Features
If you have an idea for an enhancement or a new feature:
1.  Check the [Project Roadmap](./docs/Project_Roadmap.md) to see if it's already planned.
2.  Search existing issues to see if a similar idea has already been discussed.
3.  If new, open an issue to propose your idea. Provide a clear description of the feature, why it would be beneficial, and any potential implementation ideas you might have. This allows for discussion before significant development work begins.

### Code Contributions
1.  **Prerequisites:**
    - Ensure you have Node.js (version specified in `Deployment_Guide.md` or latest LTS) and npm/yarn installed.
    - Familiarize yourself with the project's [Coding Standards](./docs/Coding_Standards.md) and [Technical Architecture](./docs/Technical_Architecture.md).

2.  **Fork & Clone:**
    - Fork the official NexusHub repository on GitHub.
    - Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nexushub.git`
    - Navigate into the project directory: `cd nexushub`

3.  **Set Up Upstream Remote:**
    - Add the original repository as an upstream remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/OFFICIAL_OWNER/nexushub.git` (Replace `OFFICIAL_OWNER` with the actual owner if different).

4.  **Branching:**
    - Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix from the `main` (or `develop`) branch:
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git pull upstream main # Keep your main branch up-to-date
      git checkout -b feature/your-descriptive-feature-name
      # or
      git checkout -b fix/issue-number-short-description
      ```

5.  **Development:**
    - Set up your local environment:
        - Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
        - Create a `.env.local` file by copying `.env.example` (if it exists) and fill in the necessary environment variables as described in the [Deployment Guide](./docs/Deployment_Guide.md). This typically includes MongoDB URI, DB Name, and AI API keys.
    - Run the development server: `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`).
    - Make your code changes. Follow the coding standards.
    - Write unit tests and integration tests for new functionality or bug fixes.

6.  **Testing:**
    - Run tests: `npm test` (or equivalent command if test scripts are defined). Ensure all tests pass.

7.  **Formatting & Linting:**
    - Format your code: `npm run format` (if a Prettier script is set up).
    - Lint your code: `npm run lint` (if an ESLint script is set up). Fix any linting errors.

8.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    - Stage your changes: `git add .`
    - Commit with a clear and descriptive message. Follow conventional commit message formats if adopted by the project (e.g., `feat: Add user profile editing`, `fix: Resolve login error on invalid credentials`).
      ```bash
      git commit -m "feat: Implement user avatar uploads"
      ```

9.  **Keep Your Branch Up-to-Date:**
    - Periodically rebase your feature branch on the upstream main branch to incorporate the latest changes and avoid complex merge conflicts:
      ```bash
      git fetch upstream
      git rebase upstream/main
      ```
      Resolve any conflicts that arise.

10. **Push to Your Fork:**
    - Push your feature branch to your fork on GitHub:
      ```bash
      git push origin feature/your-descriptive-feature-name
      ```

11. **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    - Go to your fork on GitHub and click the "New pull request" button.
    - Ensure the base repository and branch are set to the official NexusHub repository's `main` (or `develop`) branch, and the head repository and branch are your fork and feature branch.
    - Provide a clear title for your PR.
    - Write a detailed description of the changes you've made.
    - Link to any relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
    - Ensure your PR passes any automated checks (CI builds, tests, linters).
    - Be prepared to discuss your changes and make further modifications based on feedback from maintainers.

## Style Guides
- **Code:** Adhere to the [Coding Standards](./docs/Coding_Standards.md).
- **Documentation:** For contributions to documentation, use Markdown.
- **Git Commit Messages:** Keep them concise and descriptive.
