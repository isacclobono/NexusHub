## Version 0.5.0
*Date: (Previous Build Date)*

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Polls in Posts:**
    - Users can create posts with a "poll" type, define a question (title), and add multiple choice options.
    - Authenticated users can vote once per poll.
    - Poll results (vote counts and percentages) are displayed after a user has voted or if the poll is closed (closing mechanism TBD).
    - `Post` data model updated with `postType`, `pollOptions`, `totalVotes`, `userVotedOptionId`.
    - API route `POST /api/posts/[postId]/vote` created to handle votes.
    - UI updated in `CreatePostForm`, `EditPostForm`, `PostCard`, and `PostPage` to support poll creation, display, and interaction.
- **Content Reporting - User Feedback Notifications:**
    - Users now receive notifications when the status of a report they submitted is updated by an admin/moderator.
    - New notification types: `report_reviewed_action_taken`, `report_reviewed_no_action`.
    - New API route `PATCH /api/reports/[reportId]/status` to simulate admin action on reports and trigger notifications.
    - `Report` type updated with optional `reviewNotes`.
    - "My Reports" page now displays `reviewNotes` and uses improved status badges.

### üöÄ Improvements
- **Community Settings UI:** Streamlined description for transferring ownership in `CommunitySettingsPage`.
- **API Stability (Event & Post Updates):**
    - Refined `PUT /api/events/[eventId]` to more accurately detect changes before updating, preventing "Event update failed" errors when no actual data was modified. Now includes detailed logging on update failure.
    - Refined `PUT /api/posts/[postId]` for more robust updates and better change detection, aiming to reduce "Post update failed" errors. Now includes detailed logging on update failure.
- **User ID Display:** User ID is now displayed on public profile pages.
- **Post Card & Post Page (Media Handling):** Improved logic for rendering different media types (image, video, document).
- **File Input Components:** Standardized file type constants and max file size for uploads.

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Toast Notification Error:** Fixed `toast.info is not a function` error in `PostCard.tsx` by using `toast()` for informational messages.
- **Time Input Value/DefaultValue Conflict:** Resolved console errors in date/time pickers across event and post forms by ensuring time inputs are fully controlled components using `value` instead of `defaultValue`.
- **Quill Editor Content Display:** Improved stability of the Quill editor in `EditPostForm.tsx` to correctly display and update content, especially when the `value` prop changes.
- **Missing Imports:** Added `ObjectId` import to `src/components/feed/PostCard.tsx`.
