# System Design Document (SDD) for NexusHub

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the high-level system design and architecture for the NexusHub platform. It describes the major components, their interactions, and the technologies used.

## 2. System Architecture
### 2.1 Architectural Style
NexusHub employs a client-server architecture. The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with Next.js (App Router), and the backend consists of API routes also handled by Next.js. This leverages a full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript environment.

### 2.3 Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend (API):** Next.js API Routes (Node.js runtime environment)
- **Database:** MongoDB (Cloud-hosted, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- **AI Engine:** Google Genkit, utilizing Gemini models for various AI tasks.
- **Authentication:** Custom implementation using bcryptjs for password hashing and session management (simulated via client-side session storage for prototype).
- **File Storage:** Local filesystem (`public/uploads/`) for development/prototyping. Production would require a cloud storage solution (e.g., Firebase Storage, AWS S3).
- **Deployment (Current/Planned):** Firebase App Hosting or similar PaaS (Vercel, Netlify).

## 3. Data Design
### 3.1 Database Schema
A detailed database schema is available in `Database_Design.md`. Key collections include `users`, `posts`, `comments`, `events`, `communities`, `notifications`, and `reports`.

### 3.2 Data Flow Examples
- **User Registration:** Client sends form data -> `/api/register` -> Validates data, hashes password -> Stores new user in MongoDB.
- **Post Creation:** Client sends post data (text, media info) -> `/api/posts` -> Validates data, performs AI moderation/categorization -> Stores post in MongoDB, updates user/community associations.
- **Feed Loading:** Client requests `/api/posts` -> API queries MongoDB for relevant posts (applying personalization if applicable) -> Returns posts to client.

## 4. Component Design
### 4.1 Frontend Components
- **UI Primitives:** Located in `src/components/ui/` (ShadCN components).
- **Feature-Specific Components:** Located in `src/components/[feature]/` (e.g., `src/components/feed/PostCard.tsx`).
- **Layout Components:** `AppShell`, `Header`, `Sidebar` in `src/components/layout/`.
- **Page Components:** Located in `src/app/[route]/page.tsx` using Next.js App Router conventions.

### 4.2 Backend API Endpoints
- API routes are organized by resource under `src/app/api/`. For example, user-related APIs are in `src/app/api/users/`, post APIs in `src/app/api/posts/`.
- Each route typically handles specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.
- Request validation is performed using Zod.
- Database interactions are handled via `lib/mongodb.ts`.

### 4.3 AI Flows (Genkit)
- Defined in `src/ai/flows/`.
- Examples:
    - `intelligent-content-moderation.ts`: Flags potentially harmful content.
    - `smart-content-categorization.ts`: Suggests categories and tags for posts.
    - `personalized-feed-curation.ts`: Reorders feed content based on user interaction models.
- These flows are invoked by relevant backend API routes.

## 5. Deployment Architecture
- The Next.js application (frontend and API routes) is deployed as a single unit.
- Static assets are served by the hosting provider.
- The MongoDB database is a separate cloud-hosted service.
- Genkit AI services are accessed via API calls to Google AI.

## 6. Security Considerations
- Authentication is handled by API routes, verifying user credentials and managing sessions (simulated).
- Authorization checks are implemented in API routes to ensure users can only perform actions they are permitted to.
- Input validation (Zod) is used on both client and server sides.
- For detailed security measures, refer to `Security_Plan.md`.

## 7. Scalability and Performance
- **Next.js:** Offers server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) capabilities, which can be leveraged for performance. Server Components improve client-side bundle size.
- **MongoDB:** Horizontal scalability through sharding (managed by MongoDB Atlas). Proper indexing is crucial.
- **Serverless Functions (API Routes):** Scale automatically with demand on most PaaS platforms.
- **AI Services:** Google AI services are designed for scalability.
