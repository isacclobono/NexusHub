# NexusHub Security Plan

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the security strategy, policies, and measures implemented to protect the NexusHub platform, its users, and their data. Security is an ongoing process and will be continuously reviewed and updated.

## 2. Data Security
### 2.1 Data Classification
- **Public Data:** General site content, public user profiles, public community information.
- **Sensitive Data:** User email addresses, hashed passwords, password reset tokens, private messages (future), some AI model inputs/outputs.
- **Confidential Data:** API keys, database credentials, admin user credentials.

### 2.2 Data at Rest Encryption
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas provides encryption at rest by default for all data stored.
- **File Storage (Production):** If using cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Firebase Storage), server-side encryption will be enabled.
- **Secrets:** API keys, database credentials, and other secrets are managed using environment variables and, in production, a secrets management service provided by the hosting platform (e.g., Firebase Secret Manager, Vercel Environment Variables).

### 2.3 Data in Transit Encryption
- **HTTPS/TLS:** All communication between the client (browser) and the NexusHub server (Next.js backend) will be encrypted using HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher).
- **Internal Communication:** Communication between backend services and the database (MongoDB Atlas) should also use encrypted connections.

## 3. Authentication and Access Control
### 3.1 User Authentication
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are hashed using `bcryptjs` with a sufficient salt factor before being stored in the database.
- **Password Policies:** Passwords must be at least 8 characters long (enforced client-side and server-side). Future enhancements may include complexity requirements.
- **Login Security:** Implement measures against brute-force attacks (e.g., rate limiting on login attempts - future).
- **Password Reset:** Secure token-based password reset mechanism with token expiry.
- **Session Management (Current):** Simulated via client-side `sessionStorage`.
- **Session Management (Production Recommendation):** Use secure, httpOnly cookies with appropriate flags (SameSite, Secure) for session tokens or JWTs. Consider using a library like NextAuth.js for robust session management.

### 3.2 Authorization
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users and system components should only have access to the resources and actions necessary for their role.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    - **User:** Basic permissions.
    - **Community Creator/Admin:** Permissions to manage their specific community.
    - **Platform Administrator (Future):** Global administrative privileges.
- **Ownership Checks:** API endpoints rigorously check if the authenticated user has the right to perform actions on specific resources (e.g., only the author can edit/delete their post, only community creator can modify community settings).

## 4. Application Security
### 4.1 Input Validation
- **Client-Side Validation:** Using Zod with `react-hook-form` to provide immediate feedback to users.
- **Server-Side Validation:** All data received by API endpoints is strictly validated using Zod schemas before processing. This is the primary defense against malformed or malicious input.

### 4.2 Output Encoding & Content Sanitization
- **XSS Prevention:**
    - React inherently escapes data rendered in JSX, providing protection against XSS.
    - User-generated HTML content (e.g., from the Quill rich text editor) is sanitized using `DOMPurify` on the client-side before rendering or on the server-side before storing, to remove potentially malicious scripts.
- **Secure Headers:** Implement security-related HTTP headers (e.g., Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security).

### 4.3 Protection Against Common Web Vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- **Injection (NoSQL):** Avoid constructing MongoDB queries by directly concatenating user input. Use the MongoDB driver's BSON capabilities, which inherently prevent NoSQL injection if used correctly.
- **Broken Authentication:** Addressed by strong password hashing, secure session management (production), and MFA (future).
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Minimized by encrypting data at rest and in transit, and only exposing necessary data via APIs.
- **XML External Entities (XXE):** Not directly applicable as XML is not a primary data format.
- **Broken Access Control:** Addressed by robust authorization checks in API routes.
- **Security Misconfiguration:** Regular review of server, database, and framework configurations. Keep software up-to-date.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Addressed by output encoding and content sanitization.
- **Insecure Deserialization:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data.
- **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:** Regularly audit dependencies (`npm audit`) and update them.
- **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring:** Implement logging for security events and monitor for anomalies (future enhancement for production).

### 4.4 API Security
- **Endpoint Protection:** All API endpoints that modify data or access sensitive information require authentication.
- **Rate Limiting (Future):** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
- **Secure API Keys:** Keys for external services (e.g., Google AI) are stored as environment variables/secrets and not exposed client-side.

### 4.5 File Upload Security
- **Type Validation:** Server-side validation of file MIME types (`ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` in `/api/upload/route.ts`).
- **Size Validation:** Server-side validation of file size (`MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES`).
- **Filename Sanitization:** Generate unique filenames on the server to prevent path traversal or overwrite attacks.
- **Content Scanning (Future):** For production, consider integrating malware scanning for uploaded files.
- **Serving Uploaded Files:** Serve files from a non-primary domain or a dedicated storage service with appropriate security headers to mitigate risks.

## 5. AI Content Moderation & Safety
- **Genkit AI Flows:**
    - `intelligentContentModeration`: Flags potentially harmful or offensive content in posts.
    - `Gemini Safety Filters`: Utilize the built-in safety filters of the Gemini models, configured in Genkit prompts.
- **Reporting System:** Users can report inappropriate content or behavior.

## 6. Dependency Management
- **Regular Updates:** Keep all third-party libraries and frameworks (Node.js, Next.js, MongoDB driver, Genkit, etc.) up-to-date with security patches.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools like `npm audit` or Snyk to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## 7. Logging and Monitoring (Production Focus)
- **Security Event Logging:** Log significant security events such as failed login attempts, authorization failures, password resets, and changes to critical settings.
- **Audit Trails:** Maintain audit trails for administrative actions.
- **Monitoring:** Monitor application logs and infrastructure for suspicious activity or performance anomalies that might indicate an attack.

## 8. Incident Response Plan (High-Level)
- **Preparation:** Define roles and responsibilities for incident response.
- **Identification:** Procedures for detecting and reporting security incidents.
- **Containment:** Steps to limit the scope and impact of an incident.
- **Eradication:** Removing the cause of the incident.
- **Recovery:** Restoring affected systems and data.
- **Lessons Learned:** Post-incident review to improve security measures.

## 9. Regular Security Reviews
- Conduct periodic code reviews with a security focus.
- Perform vulnerability assessments or penetration tests (simulated or actual) as the platform matures.
- Stay informed about new security threats and best practices.
