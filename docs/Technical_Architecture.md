# NexusHub Technical Architecture Document

## 1. Overview
This document details the technical architecture of the NexusHub platform. It describes the system's structure, key components, technology choices, and design considerations.

## 2. Architectural Goals
- **Scalability:** Design to accommodate a growing user base and content volume.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure code is modular, well-documented, and easy to update or extend.
- **Performance:** Optimize for fast page load times, responsive user interactions, and efficient API responses.
- **Reliability:** Build a robust system with effective error handling and data integrity.
- **Security:** Prioritize the protection of user data and platform integrity.
- **Developer Experience:** Utilize modern tools and practices for efficient development.

## 3. Layered Architecture
NexusHub employs a modern, full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript architecture, primarily leveraging the Next.js framework.

### 3.1 Presentation Layer (Frontend)
- **Technology:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript.
- **UI Components:** ShadCN UI (a collection of reusable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework).
- **State Management:**
    - React Context API (e.g., `AuthProvider` for global authentication state).
    - Component-level state (`useState`, `useReducer`) for local UI state.
    - `react-hook-form` for form state management and validation.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Rendering the user interface.
    - Handling user interactions and client-side logic.
    - Client-side routing (managed by Next.js App Router).
    - Making API calls to the backend.
    - Optimistic UI updates where appropriate.

### 3.2 Application Layer (Backend API)
- **Technology:** Next.js API Routes (Serverless Functions deployed typically on Node.js runtimes).
- **Language:** TypeScript.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Handling HTTP requests from the client.
    - Implementing business logic for all platform features.
    - Data validation and sanitization (using Zod).
    - Authentication and authorization.
    - Interacting with the Data Access Layer to perform database operations.
    - Integrating with external services (e.g., Genkit for AI).

### 3.3 Data Access Layer
- **Technology:** MongoDB Node.js Driver.
- **Wrapper:** A custom module (`lib/mongodb.ts`) manages MongoDB client connections and provides a `getDb()` function to access database instances.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Establishing and managing connections to the MongoDB database.
    - Executing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations against MongoDB collections.
    - Abstracting raw database queries from the application layer.

### 3.4 Database Layer
- **Technology:** MongoDB (Cloud-hosted, e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
- **Type:** NoSQL Document Database.
- **Schema:** Flexible, document-based. Key collections include `users`, `posts`, `comments`, `events`, `communities`, `notifications`, `reports`. (Refer to `Database_Design.md` for details).
- **Responsibilities:** Persistent storage of application data.

### 3.5 AI Integration Layer
- **Technology:** Google Genkit.
- **Models:** Configured to use Google AI models (e.g., Gemini).
- **Implementation:** AI "flows" are defined in TypeScript files under `src/ai/flows/`.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Providing AI-driven functionalities such as:
        - Intelligent content moderation.
        - Smart content categorization and tagging.
        - Personalized feed curation.
    - These flows are typically invoked by the backend API routes.

### 3.6 File Storage Layer
- **Development/Prototype:** Local filesystem (`public/uploads/posts/`) via `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`.
- **Production Recommendation:** A cloud-based object storage solution (e.g., Firebase Storage, AWS S3, Cloudinary) would be necessary for scalability, reliability, and serving media efficiently (potentially via a CDN). This is not yet implemented.

## 4. Key Architectural Decisions & Patterns
- **Full-Stack Next.js:** Utilizing Next.js for both frontend rendering (App Router with Server Components by default) and backend API development simplifies the tech stack and improves developer experience.
- **Server Components by Default:** Leveraging Next.js App Router's default Server Components to reduce client-side JavaScript and improve initial load times. Client Components (`'use client'`) are used where interactivity or browser-specific APIs are needed.
- **Server Actions:** Used for form submissions and data mutations directly from Server Components or Client Components, simplifying data handling without manually creating many API endpoints for simple mutations.
- **Utility-First CSS (Tailwind CSS):** Enables rapid UI development and consistent styling with a highly customizable framework.
- **Component-Based UI (ShadCN):** Promotes reusability, consistency, and accessibility through pre-built, customizable UI components.
- **Schema Validation with Zod:** Ensures data integrity and type safety for API requests and responses.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Extensive use of `async/await` for non-blocking I/O operations (API calls, database queries).

## 5. Data Flow Examples
*(This section would typically include diagrams for key flows)*
- **User Login:**
  1. User submits credentials via Login Page (Client Component).
  2. `AuthProvider`'s `login` function calls `POST /api/login`.
  3. API route validates credentials against MongoDB.
  4. On success, returns user data; `AuthProvider` updates state and stores user in `sessionStorage`.
- **Creating a Post with AI Categorization:**
  1. User submits post form (Client Component, possibly using Server Action).
  2. If Server Action, it directly calls backend logic. If API, frontend calls `POST /api/posts`.
  3. API route validates data, calls `intelligentContentModeration` flow.
  4. If moderation passes, calls `categorizeContent` flow.
  5. Saves post data (including AI suggestions) to MongoDB.
  6. Returns created post to client.

## 6. Scalability and Performance Considerations
- **Database Indexing:** Crucial for MongoDB query performance. Indexes are defined in `Database_Design.md`.
- **API Design:** Stateless API routes allow for horizontal scaling.
- **Next.js Features:**
    - Automatic code splitting.
    - Image optimization (`next/image`).
    - Caching strategies (ISR, on-demand revalidation - to be explored further).
- **File Serving:** For production, using a CDN for static assets and user-uploaded media is recommended.
- **Load Testing:** (Future) Perform load testing to identify bottlenecks.

## 7. Security Considerations
- Addressed in detail in `Security_Plan.md`. Key aspects include input validation, password hashing, content sanitization, and secure API key management.
