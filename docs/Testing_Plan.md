# NexusHub Testing Plan

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the testing strategy, types of testing, tools, and processes to be followed for ensuring the quality and reliability of the NexusHub platform.

## 2. Testing Objectives
- Verify that all functional requirements specified in the SRS are met.
- Ensure non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability) are satisfied.
- Identify and report defects in a timely manner.
- Achieve a high level of user satisfaction.
- Minimize risks associated with software failures in production.

## 3. Scope of Testing
- **In Scope:** All features and functionalities of the NexusHub web application, including frontend UI, backend API, database interactions, and AI integrations.
- **Out of Scope (Initially):**
    - Native mobile application testing (if developed later).
    - Third-party service availability testing (e.g., MongoDB Atlas uptime, Google AI service uptime - assume they are reliable, but monitor integrations).
    - Performance testing under extreme load conditions beyond initial targets.

## 4. Testing Types & Strategies

### 4.1 Unit Testing
- **Description:** Testing individual functions, methods, or components in isolation.
- **Responsibility:** Developers.
- **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library (for React components).
- **Strategy:** Aim for high coverage of critical business logic and complex UI components. Mocks and stubs will be used for external dependencies.

### 4.2 Integration Testing
- **Description:** Testing the interaction between different modules or components (e.g., frontend calling backend API, API interacting with the database or AI flows).
- **Responsibility:** Developers, QA.
- **Tools:** Jest with Supertest (for API routes), React Testing Library with MSW (Mock Service Worker) for mocking API calls from frontend.
- **Strategy:** Focus on testing interfaces between components, data flow, and integration points with external services (mocked or actual in a controlled environment).

### 4.3 End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Description:** Testing complete user flows through the application, simulating real user scenarios from the UI to the database and back.
- **Responsibility:** QA, Automation Engineers.
- **Tools:** Cypress or Playwright.
- **Strategy:** Cover critical user paths like registration, login, post creation, community joining, event RSVPing. Automate these tests to run regularly.

### 4.4 API Testing
- **Description:** Directly testing API endpoints for functionality, reliability, performance, and security.
- **Responsibility:** Developers, QA.
- **Tools:** Postman, Insomnia, or automated scripts using tools like Supertest.
- **Strategy:** Verify request/response formats, status codes, authentication/authorization, error handling, and data validation for all API routes.

### 4.5 User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Testing
- **Description:** Evaluating the application's visual design, layout, responsiveness, ease of use, and overall user satisfaction.
- **Responsibility:** QA, UI/UX Designers, Product Owner.
- **Methods:**
    - Manual exploratory testing.
    - Cross-browser and cross-device testing.
    - Usability testing with representative users (formal or informal).
    - Adherence to UI/UX Style Guide.
- **Strategy:** Ensure the UI is intuitive, accessible, and consistent across the platform.

### 4.6 Accessibility Testing (A11y)
- **Description:** Ensuring the application is usable by people with disabilities.
- **Responsibility:** Developers, QA, UI/UX Designers.
- **Tools:** Axe DevTools, Lighthouse, WAVE, manual testing with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver).
- **Standards:** Aim for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
- **Strategy:** Integrate accessibility checks into the development and testing lifecycle.

### 4.7 Performance Testing
- **Description:** Evaluating the responsiveness, stability, and scalability of the application under various load conditions.
- **Responsibility:** QA, Performance Engineers.
- **Types:**
    - **Load Testing:** Simulate expected user traffic.
    - **Stress Testing:** Push the system beyond normal operating conditions.
    - **Soak Testing:** Test for stability over an extended period.
- **Tools:** Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights (for frontend), k6, JMeter (for backend/API).
- **Metrics:** Page load time, API response time, CPU/memory usage, error rates.

### 4.8 Security Testing
- **Description:** Identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.
- **Responsibility:** Developers, Security Specialists, QA.
- **Methods:**
    - Code reviews with a security focus.
    - Dependency vulnerability scanning (e.g., `npm audit`, Snyk).
    - Testing for common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
    - Authentication and authorization testing.
    - Input validation testing.
- **Strategy:** Integrate security considerations throughout the development lifecycle. Refer to `Security_Plan.md`.

## 5. Test Environments
- **Local Development:** Developers run unit and integration tests on their machines.
- **Staging/Testing Environment:** A dedicated environment that mirrors production as closely as possible. Used for E2E testing, UAT, and pre-release validation.
- **Production Environment:** Limited smoke testing after deployments. Continuous monitoring.

## 6. Test Execution & Reporting
- **Test Cycles:** Testing will be conducted iteratively throughout development sprints.
- **Test Cases:** Documented in a test management tool or shared document, including preconditions, steps, expected results, and actual results.
- **Bug Reporting:** Defects will be logged in an issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues) with clear details:
    - Title, Description, Steps to Reproduce, Severity, Priority, Environment, Screenshots/Logs.
- **Test Summary Reports:** Generated at the end of major test cycles or releases.

## 7. Entry and Exit Criteria
- **Entry Criteria (for a testing phase):**
    - Stable build deployed to the test environment.
    - Core functionalities are testable.
    - Test plan and test cases are ready.
- **Exit Criteria (for release):**
    - All critical and high-priority bugs are fixed and verified.
    - Test coverage targets are met.
    - Successful completion of key E2E test scenarios.
    - Performance and security testing results are acceptable.
    - Sign-off from QA and Product Owner.
