    "content": "ES2023 is packed with exciting new features for JavaScript developers. From new array methods like `toReversed()`, `toSorted()`, `toSpliced()`, and `with()` to improvements in WeakMap usage with symbols, there's a lot to explore. These additions aim to make code more readable and immutable operations more straightforward. Let's dive into some examples and see how they can improve our daily coding tasks.\n\nFor instance, `Array.prototype.toSorted()` provides a non-mutating alternative to `sort()`, which is fantastic for functional programming paradigms.",
